                    <p class="lead">What is the future of healthcare? Three words: <strong>Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)</strong>. RPM enables providers to take the next level of care by bringing a large amount of real-time physiological data from connected devices. To understand RPM, we will break down RPM into three distinct steps: data acquisition, data processing, and an end-terminal that involves a communication network.</p>

                    <p class="lead">
                    First, physiological data are collected from various remotely connected devices; for example, blood pressure, glucose levels, constant weight monitoring, activity levels, and more. Next, this continuous stream of raw data is cleaned into noise-free and clinically meaningful formats. Finally, such data are displayed and consumed via an end-terminal that involves a communication network. Using a platform like this, providers can constantly monitor patients' status, connect with the patients, and dynamically adjust treatment plans.

                    RPM is not just for seriously ill patients. This technology can bring substantial value to the average patient as well. Engaging in RPM can enable your provider the ability to monitor and fix problems before they even become problems. For example, if a provider starts to see an uptrend in glucose levels, they can make an immediate adjustment to their medication, or recommend more strict diet plans. Furthermore, RPM can bring increased accountability and teamwork; oftentimes, patients leave the doctors office with a plan — that could be to lose weight, increase activity level, monitor glucose levels more frequently, etc. — but after a week or so, the goal of following the plan tends to go awry. With RPM, a provider and a patient can be on the same team monitoring the same physiological measurements and be accountable for the results together.

                    The biggest benefit of RPM, we have observed so far at Orma Health, is that patients feel they are in the loop and in control of their health. Gone are the days where a patient has to learn that they have to do things for their health every few months, or loosely follow along to a doctor explaining a bunch of technical jargon that flies over their heads. There are just far too many resources available for a patient to be left in the dark and RPM gives some of the connection back between patients and providers. It directly fosters a more balanced relationship between patient and provider where both parties are actively engaged in the goal of improving health without having to only focus on important issues once every two months.

                    RPM is not just a fancy technology with no long-term value. It bridges the gap between a patient and their provider to make sure that both parties are working together. Its value is unmatched, both for the patient looking to take control of their health and for the provider looking to deliver a higher quality of care. It's the best way to stay connected, something that is important in a time where we all are tasked to stay apart. RPM provides a path for a sustainable future in healthcare and both patients and providers alike should expect to see it take a part in their lives soon.
